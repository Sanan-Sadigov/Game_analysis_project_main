The data output is organized into columns for each day and platform, capturing various aspects of user engagement:

- **DAU (Daily Active Users):** Total unique users connected on a given day.
- **New Players:** Total new unique users who entered the app on a specific day.
- **Sessions:** Raw total of game sessions.
- **Matches:** Raw total of matches started by users.
- **Losses:** Raw total of matches lost by users.
- **Wins:** Raw total of matches won by users.

## Analysis Focus

The analysis provides additional insights into user behavior and demographics:

- **Paying Users:** Categorizes users into those who have spent real money in the game and those who have not.
- **Country Analysis:** Captures the country of each player, enabling geographical analysis.
- **Platform:** Identifies the platform used by the player (e.g., console or Steam).
- **Clan Joined:** Indicates whether a player has joined a clan before making a purchase.
